# ☕ NeverApart Café – Soulmate App

> Welcome to NeverApart Café — a quiet corner of the internet where hearts don’t rush, and gestures speak louder than swipes.  
> Here, love begins with a coffee, deepens with a flower, and whispers through a private chat room lit by kindness.  
>  
> If you believe in timing, in poetry, and in the beauty of not rushing... pull up a chair.  
> This café was brewed just for you.
